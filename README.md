# UFO Analysis
## Overview of the UFO Analysis
### Purpose
Dana, a data journalist, decided the topic she wanted to write about was UFOs. She has a JavaScript file filled with UFO sightings. She wants to include a table of all of the sightings along with her article. However, since there are so many sighting entries she decided that utilizing filters will allow her readers to better sift through the data. Through JavaScript we were able to create filters for the date, city, state, country, and shape of UFO.  
## Results

Using the filters is very easy. When you first open the website the table depicts all of the sighting data (as shown above). Additionally, the filter options display an example of how the syntax needs to be written for each filter. We were able to display the format examples of the filters through a "placeholder" parameter in our html file.

If you wanted to filter just based off of the date, you can enter a date and then press enter. In the screenshot above, I entered 1/9/2010. As you can see, I recieved 11 results for that specific date. Additionally, if you wanted to filter just based off of the city, you can enter a city and the press enter. So on and so forth for the state, country, and shape filters.

You can also filter the data through a number of filters. For example, in the screenshot above, I specified the date, state, and shape and received 2 results. I entered the city, state, and shape and then pressed enter. As you use this interactive filter, you can see as you specify one filter and move on to the next the table filters as well. However, when you input your last desired filter you need to press enter. You can use as many or as less filters as you'd like.

There is a possibility if you enter a filter and no data is presented (as shown above) then there is no sighting data for that filter or set of filters. For example, there have not been any UFO sightings in Idaho.
