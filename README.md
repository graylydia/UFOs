## Overview of the UFO Analysis
### Purpose
Dana, a data journalist, decided the topic she wanted to write about was UFOs. She has a JavaScript file filled with UFO sightings. She wants to include a table of all of the sightings along with her article. However, since there are so many sighting entries she decided that utilizing filters will allow her readers to better sift through the data. Through JavaScript we were able to create filters for the date, city, state, country, and shape of UFO.
